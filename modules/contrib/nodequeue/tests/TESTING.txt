===================================
    Notes on testing 7.x-2.x
===================================


testNodequeueModifyLabel() fails
---------------------------------------
- The nodequeue tab label doesn't take effect unless the menu cache is cleared, but we don't do that automatically. Should we?


testNodequeueEditFormRoles() fails
---------------------------------------
- Need to find out why it fails and fix it.


testNodequeueAccess() fails
---------------------------------------
- Need to find out why this fails. It seems like it should be passing.


testNodequeueQueueOperations() fails
---------------------------------------
- This form uses AJAX now. We need to rewrite these tests.


NodequeueApacheSolrUnitTest fails
---------------------------------------
- Need to fix Apache Solr tests.
